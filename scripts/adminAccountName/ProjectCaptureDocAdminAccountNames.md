# Project Capture Document for Extension: Admin Account Names
#### *Author: Theron Dowdle*
#### *Stakeholder(s): Corey Moore and Team*
#### *Date: 3/28/2019*


## Background

In Canvas, when you click the `Admin` tab, it will show the subaccounts you have access to.  There are some subaccounts that have other 'qualifier' names such as `Archived`.  The tab shows the qualifier name instead of the name of the subaccount, so it will show multiple instances of Archived without any other information on the subaccount.  Corey requested a tool that would show both the original name of the subaccount and the qualifier.

<!-- 

Explain the context of the problem.
Explain key terms/words, words that may be unfamiliar to a new hire.


Do Example: 
    
    Corey and his team have been manually going through the html for all images in canvas and filling in the alt attribute. This has been very time consuming. 
    - Alt image text, also called "image alt text", or just "alt text", is the text that appears on html pages if the image fails to load.

## Definition of Done

This tool should display the original name of the subaccount along with the qualifier

<!-- 

What is/are the project outcome(s)?
("Can you give me one sentence describing what you want done?")
We are trying to clean up the yard by Mow, Edge, and Rake.

Do Example:

    We are creating a tool to find all images that are in need of alt text in canvas which will automate this process by showing an image and prompting for alt text.

# Requirements

### General Requirements

### Input Requirements

#### Definition of Inputs

No user inputs

<!-- List here a type definition for each input. For example, if it is a CSV define the column names. If it is a JSON, give an example of the JSON structure. If it is user input, what will the user be asked for? -->

#### Source of Inputs

No user inputs

<!-- Paragraph of how to get inputs. From who? From where: Slack, email, server...? This also includes user selected options at runtime. How will we know what options to select? For example, in conversion tool, you'd follow the values on the Trello Board. It would also include the steps to get access to the information you need, such as getting added to a Trello Board, or access to a server. -->

### Output Requirements

#### Definition of Outputs

Adjusts what is displayed on the `Admin` tab of Canvas so it shows both the name of the subaccount, and any qualifiers it may have. 

<!-- List here a type definition for each output? For example, if the changes are directly to the LMS, list all changes that occur. If it is a CSV define the column names. If it is a JSON, give an example of the JSON structure. -->

#### Destination of Outputs

Directly on LMS

<!-- Paragraph where/who to send outputs. To who? To where: Email, server, directly to LMS...? It would also include the steps to get access to the locations you need, such as getting added to a Trello Board, or access to a server, or the LMS. -->

---

### User Interface

#### Type:

Adjusts the display of the `Admin` tab of Canvas

<!-- CLI with Flags, CLI With Prompt, Web Page, Server, Library, etc -->

<!-- What are the flags, what are Major Questions, Images of UX/UI Design. -->

-----

## Expectations

### Timeline: Done

<!-- Include Milestone List here with Deadlines and try to make each milestone a minimum viable product
- Milestone 1: Finish Design (3/19)
- Milestone 2: Build Core logic to search for words in syllabi (3/22)
- Milestone 3: Connect inputs to core logic and set up outputs (3/25)
- Milestone 4: Deliver the project (3/26)
This will probably be overkill for small projects -->

### Best Mode of Contact: Slack/email

### Next Meeting: N/A
