# Requirements

### General Requirements

### Input Requirements

#### Definition of Inputs

No user input

<!-- List here a type definition for each input. For example, if it is a CSV define the column names. If it is a JSON, give an example of the JSON structure. If it is user input, what will the user be asked for? -->

#### Source of Inputs

No user input

<!-- Paragraph of how to get inputs. From who? From where: Slack, email, server...? This also includes user selected options at runtime. How will we know what options to select? For example, in conversion tool, you'd follow the values on the Trello Board. It would also include the steps to get access to the information you need, such as getting added to a Trello Board, or access to a server. -->

## Expectations

<!-- Include Milestone List here with Deadlines and try to make each milestone a minimum viable product
- Milestone 1: Finish Design (3/19)
- Milestone 2: Build Core logic to search for words in syllabi (3/22)
- Milestone 3: Connect inputs to core logic and set up outputs (3/25)
- Milestone 4: Deliver the project (3/26)
This will probably be overkill for small projects -->
