# Project Capture Document for Extension: Lock/Unlock Blueprint Items
#### *Author: Theron Dowdle*
#### *Stakeholder(s): Corey Moore and Team*
#### *Date: 3/29/2019*


## Background

Corey and his team were given the task to lock all blueprint items in many courses.  Those buttons were often difficult to click because they were alternating between visible and not-visible.  They requested a tool that would do this for them. 

-----

## Definition of Done

This tool will add a button to the extension popup that will automatically lock all blueprint items on the page it is run on. 
While testing, I needed the tool to unlock those items as well, and I left that feature there.
