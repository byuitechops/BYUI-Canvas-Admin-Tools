#### *Author: Theron Dowdle*

#### *Date: 3/29/2019*


## Background

Corey and his team do a lot of work in course Modules in Canvas. Courses often have many modules, and it is kind of a pain to find a module through scrolling, especially if that course has a lot of modules, or those modules are long. They requested a feature on the extension that would add a quick link to the different modules in a course.

-----

## Definition of Done

This tool will add a bar to the bottom of the window containing a link to each module in that course, thus allowing significantly faster navigation of modules.
