# Project Capture Document for Extension: Delete Quiz Questions
#### *Author: Theron Dowdle*
#### *Stakeholder(s): Corey Moore and Team*
#### *Date: 3/29/2019*


## Background

Corey and his team requested a feature that would delete all the questions of a quiz, without deleting the quiz itself.

<!-- 

Explain the context of the problem.
Explain key terms/words, words that may be unfamiliar to a new hire.


Do Example: 
    
    Corey and his team have been manually going through the html for all images in canvas and filling in the alt attribute. This has been very time consuming. 
    - Alt image text, also called "image alt text", or just "alt text", is the text that appears on html pages if the image fails to load.

Don't Example:

    Aaron TODO

## Definition of Done

This tool will delete all the questions of a quiz, without removing the quiz itself.

<!-- 

What is/are the project outcome(s)?
("Can you give me one sentence describing what you want done?")
We are trying to clean up the yard by Mow, Edge, and Rake.

Do Example:

    We are creating a tool to find all images that are in need of alt text in canvas which will automate this process by showing an image and prompting for alt text.

Don't Example:

    Aaron TODO

# Requirements

### General Requirements

### Input Requirements

#### Definition of Inputs

* Button click to delete the quiz questions  
* Confirm that they want all the questions deleted

<!-- List here a type definition for each input. For example, if it is a CSV define the column names. If it is a JSON, give an example of the JSON structure. If it is user input, what will the user be asked for? -->

#### Source of Inputs

* The first button is in the extension popup 
* The button to confirm the delete is an alert

<!-- Paragraph of how to get inputs. From who? From where: Slack, email, server...? This also includes user selected options at runtime. How will we know what options to select? For example, in conversion tool, you'd follow the values on the Trello Board. It would also include the steps to get access to the information you need, such as getting added to a Trello Board, or access to a server. -->

### Output Requirements

#### Definition of Outputs

All questions in a quiz deleted

<!-- List here a type definition for each output? For example, if the changes are directly to the LMS, list all changes that occur. If it is a CSV define the column names. If it is a JSON, give an example of the JSON structure. -->

#### Destination of Outputs

Directly on the LMS

<!-- Paragraph where/who to send outputs. To who? To where: Email, server, directly to LMS...? It would also include the steps to get access to the locations you need, such as getting added to a Trello Board, or access to a server, or the LMS. -->

## Expectations

### Timeline: Done

<!-- Include Milestone List here with Deadlines and try to make each milestone a minimum viable product
- Milestone 1: Finish Design (3/19)
- Milestone 2: Build Core logic to search for words in syllabi (3/22)
- Milestone 3: Connect inputs to core logic and set up outputs (3/25)
- Milestone 4: Deliver the project (3/26)
This will probably be overkill for small projects -->

### Best Mode of Contact: Slack/email
